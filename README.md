# algorithm and Go
This is my repo about  some algorithms and some go skills. In my honest, the code style  and code level here are the highest I master at the moment.

- algorithm

  most problems come from leetcode，and some are from the company interview.

  - spent about 10 days on problem 1~50 in leetcode，from May 26,2022 to  June 9,2022, I think it is a  milestone that  is  worth to remember it.

- go

  inner go, to know the detail about go.
