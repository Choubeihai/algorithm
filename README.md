# algorithm and Go
This is my repo about  some algorithms and some go skills. In my honest, the code style  and code level here are the highest I master at the moment.

- algorithm

  most problems come from leetcodeï¼Œand some are from the company interview.

  - May 26, 2022 - June 9, 2022. spent about 10 days on problem 1~50 in leetcode. I think it is a  milestone that  is  worth to remember it.
  - June 9, 2022 - June 25, 2022, spent about 15 days on problem 51-100 (without 68) in leetcode. I also really think it is a milestone. The reason why this time
    is slower than last one is the busy work take me a lot of time.

- go

  inner go, to know the detail about go.
